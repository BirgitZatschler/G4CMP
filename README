G4CMP -- Geant4 add-on framework for phonon and charge-carrier physics

	D. Brant, P. Redl, R. Agnese, M. Kelsey (who else?)


This package provide a collection of particle types, physics processes, and
supporting utilities to simulate a limiting set of solid-state physics
processes in Geant4.  Developed for the low-temperature community, the
package support production and propagation of acoustic phonons and
electron-hole pairs through solid crystals such as germanium.


Defining the Crystal Dynamics
=============================

In a user's application, each active G4CMP material (e.g., germanium
crystals or diamonds) must have a collection of dynamical parameters
defined.  These parameters are used by the phonon and charge-carrier
processes to know how to create, propagate, and scatter the particles
through the crystal.

Each material's parameters are stored in a subdirectory under CrystalMaps
(or wherever the envrionment variable G4LATTICEDATA points).  G4CMP is
distributed with germanium data, in CrystalMaps/Ge/.  We recommend naming
additional directories by element or material, matching the Geant4
conventions.

The parameter definition file is config.txt.  Each line starts with a
keyword, followed by one or more values.
