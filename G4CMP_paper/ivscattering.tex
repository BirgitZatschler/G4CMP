Electron propagation was discussed in the previous section, and one interesting feature that emerges from the equations is that electrons propagate through the crystal in one of four distinct valleys \cite{Cabrera,Leman}. Electrons are not bound to those valleys permanently, however, and can scatter between valleys. This process is known as inter-valley scattering and can occur in one of two ways: 1. an electron can scatter of the lattice or 2. of an impurity in the crystal structure \cite{iv}. Both processes are dependent on the electric field strength and for larger fields ($\gtrsim$5~V/m) lattice scattering is the dominant process, while for lower fields ($\sim$1~V/m) impurity scattering becomes dominant. The EDELWEISS \cite{edelweiss} collaboration determined the scattering rates as a function of the electric field for typical Ge crystals \cite{iv}. We use the results obtained in these studies to set the inter-valley scattering amplitude in the Geant4 framework and compare it to previous implementation of the charge transport code \cite{Cabrera,Leman}. The result of electrons and holes propagating through 2.54~cm of Ge in a 0.5~V/m electric field is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intervalley}. The top two panels show the result with inter-valley scattering turned on while the bottom two panels show the result for inter-valley scattering turned off. The panels on the right show the results for the legacy simulation \cite{Cabrera,Leman} with somewhat less statistics than the Geant4 simulations. The bottom two panels also show the hole transport through the crystal with the result being the gray contour in the center.
