Do not attempt to build/run this code. It has not been kept up to date with 
other changes in G4CMP. It was originally meant to demonstrate some phonon 
physics phenomena, which will eventually be included in the phonon demo.

The code is still here so that we can refer to it when we add to the phonon
demo.
